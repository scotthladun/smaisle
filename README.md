# Introducing the Smaisle App

With everything that's going on in the world we don't have time to spend browsing in grocery stores for hours (and if you're like me, I go back and fourth while I'm shopping because I never know where anything is). Smaisle is a simple website that helps users create their grocery list, and then helps them find the items in the store by section or aisle.
I am brand new to using MongoDB and pretty new to developing using React, so this project helped me learn lots! In MongoDB I used the Atlas Search capabilities for assisting users to find what they're looking for, as well as the RealmSDK to make database calls from within the website.

##Potential Future Features
**Browse and Compare Multiple Stores**
Right now users are only able to view the scraped data that I uploaded to the database from one grocery store. A potential update could be comparing prices and products from a variety of different stores in the user's area.

**Crowdsourcing Aisle Data**
Data on the aisles that products are kept in is not available online, and varies from store to store. It would be cool if users could scan a barcode of a product and update the location of it within a specific store to help others out.
